# (C)oncept et (O)utils (S)tatistique pour les (Mo)deles (S)tochastiques


## Overview
This graph represent an overview of the structure of Cosmos.
Cosmos is divided in two main parts.
- The code generator,
	In blue on the graph do several things:
	+ Parse the command line and the input files
	+ Generate C++ code from the input files.
	+ Run one or several Simulators as independent processes and aggregate their
		result.
	+ Make some statistical analysis of the results and choose when to stop the
		simulators.
	The main function is in the file Cosmos.cpp .
- The Simulators, in green and red on the graph, simulate the trajectory
	of the system as fast as possible. results are send back to the Model
	Generator. Part of files of the simulators are generated, in red on the 
	graph. the main function is in the file clientsim.cpp

![Overview of the structure](../overview.png)


## Code generation and compilation
As part of the simulators is generated at runtime, those part must be compile
also at runtime. When the tool is compile the files in the directory Cosmos are
compiled and put in a library called libClientSim.a in the lib directory.

During the execution the model generator produce the missing part of the
simulator in the temporary directory.
Then it compiled them and link them to the library to build an executable.

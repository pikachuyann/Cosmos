# Description (required)
Description=It is a sequential covering algorithm, which was invented to cope with numeric data without discretization. Actually the nominal and numeric attributes are treated in the same way: attribute's space is being searched to find the best rule condition during rule induction. This algorithm contains some aspects of Rough Set Theory: the class definition can be described accordingly to its lower or upper approximation. For more information, see: Stefanowski, Jerzy. The rough set based rule induction technique for classification problems. In: Proc. 6th European Congress on Intelligent Techniques and Soft Computing, vol. 1. Aachen, 1998. s. 109-113.

% This program calculates Hansen and Jaszkiewicz's R1_R, R2_R and R3_R
% measures for evaluating the quality of sets of nondominated vectors with
% respect to a reference set
%
% Usage:
%   rIndicator(dataFile, referenceSet, idealPoint, nadirPoint, rho, ...
%              method, variant)
%     (all objectives are to be minimized)
%
%   dataFile:     Specifies a matrix (n x d) that contains the output of
%                 a run of a multiobjective optimizer (required)
%
%   referenceSet: Is the name of a matrix (m x d) that contains the
%                 reference set (required)
%
%   idealPoint:   Vector of length d giving the co-ordinates of an ideal
%                 reference point in the objective space (required)
%
%   nadirPoints:  Vector of length d giving the co-ordinates of a nadir
%                 (or worst) point in the objective space. When comparing
%                 two sets of results, it is VERY IMPORTANT that the same
%                 reference point is used. The reference point must be
%                 worse in all dimensions than the worst value of any point
%                 in each dimension (required)
%
%   rho:          This scalar is used in the calculation of the augmented
%                 Tchebycheff function. It controls the degree to which the
%                 Thebycheff function is augmented by a weighted sum
%                 function. Values in the range 0.001 to 0.1 are normal.
%                 This number is ignored if the augmented Tchebycheff
%                 function is not being used (optional, default 0.01)
%
%   method:       Integer in {1,2,3} which specifies whether the
%                 weighted sum (1), Thebycheff (min-max) (2), or
%                 augmented Thebycheff function (3) is used in the
%                 calculation of the R1 and R2 metrics
%                 (optional, default 3)
%
%  variant:       Integer in {1,2,3} which specifieswhich of the R_R
%                 metrics is calculated (optional, default 2)

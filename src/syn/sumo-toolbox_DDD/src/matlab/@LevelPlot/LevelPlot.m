% > @brief The class holds the data necessary to generate LevelPlots.
% >
% > These are stacked area plots that plot the accuracy
% > histogram of a surrogate model in funciton of the number of samples (or modeling iteration).
% > Each level plot object contains a profiler object which is responsible for the actual plot generation.
